# Web Practice Projects

## Overview
This repository contains my web development practice projects. Each project is based on designs provided by talented designers or created by myself. The goal is to improve my skills and build a portfolio showcasing my ability to transform beautiful visual designs into functional websites.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into subfolders, with each subfolder containing the development of a different web page project. Some of these projects are based on designs from other designers, while others are my original designs.

## List of Projects
- [AiCURA Project](./web-aicura/README.md)
- [BLOCKBUSTER Project](./web-blockbuster/README.md)

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the code and see how each design has been translated into a working website. Each project folder contains all the necessary files, along with a README.md file that provides details about the project and any specific instructions.

## Contact
If you have any questions or need further information about any of the projects, please feel free to reach out to me at camilaspaldingdg@gmail.com.

## Acknowledgments
A huge thank you to all the designers who have generously allowed me to use their work for my practice projects. Your creativity and support are greatly appreciated!
